# Vue Reference Documentation Website

Link: https://vuereference.com/

### Objectives

1. Build a website to store Vue 3 documentation.
2. Get users to sign up for my email list.
3. Create a blogging platform using markup text (no need to use HTML tags).
4. Build a learning platform with progress tracking.

### Results

1. Vue documentation is easily viewed, and I refer to my own documentation a year later. (Finished implementation, still updating content)
2. Have 70+ email subscribers using the MailerLite API and serverless functions through Netlify's interface of AWS. (Finished implementation)
3. Three published blogs using Nuxt Content for easy markup. (Finished implementation, still updating content)
4. Utilizing Supabase for authentication and database capabilities. Objective tracking is added. (In progress)

### Technologies

1. Vue 3
2. Nuxt
3. Netlify (hosting and serverless functions)
4. MailterLite API (email lists)
5. Supabase for Authentication and Postgre SQL Database interactions
6. Nuxt Content
7. GraphQL (for learning purposes)
8. Pinia

### Final thoughts

This project was a great opportunity to implement several technologies working together to accomplish business tasks. For example, creating an account on Supabase while also subscribing users via email. I have moved on to other projects that are currently taking up my time, so the functionality of this project may not work anymore in relation to Supabase (as I am utilizing my free resources elsewhere for new, improved projects). However, besides account validation and creation, everything else should work.
