# Vue Reference Documentation Website

Link: https://vuereference.com/

### Objectives

1. Build a website that I can store Vue 3 documentation
2. Get user's to signup to my email list
3. Create Blogging platform using markup text (no need to use html tags)
4. Build learning platform with progress tracking

### Results

1. Vue documentation is easily viewed and I use it a year later to refer to my own documentation. (Finished implementation, still updating content)
2. Have over 70+ email subscribers using the MailerLite API and serverless functions through Netlify's interface of AWS. (Finished implementation)
3. Three published blogs that use Nuxt Content for easy markup. (Finished implementation, still updating content)
4. Utilizing Supabase for authentication and for database capabilities. Objective tracking is added. (in progress)

### Technologies

1. Vue 3
2. Nuxt
3. Netlify (hosting and serverless functions)
4. MailterLite API (email lists)
5. Supabase for Authentication and Postgre SQL Database interactions
6. Nuxt Content
7. GraphQL (for learning purposes)
8. Pinia

### Final thoughts

This was a great project to implement several technologies to work together to accomplish business tasks. For example, being able to create account on supabase while also subscribing user's via email. I have moved on to other projects that are taking up my time, so the functionality of this project may not work anymore in relation to supabase (as I am utilizing my free resources elsewhere for new, improved projects). But besides account validation and creation, everything else should work.
