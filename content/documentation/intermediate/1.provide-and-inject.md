# Provide and Inject

<mark>provide</mark> allows a component to share its state with its descendants, while inject allows a component to access the state provided by its ancestors.

Here's an example of how to use <mark>provide</mark> and <mark>inject</mark> in a Vue.js application:

```vue
// Parent component

export default {
  name: 'Parent',
  provide() {
    return {
      theme: 'dark'
    }
  },
  template: `
    <div>
      <Child />
    </div>
  `
}
```

```vue
// Child component

export default {
  name: 'Child',
  inject: ['theme'],
  template: `
    <div :class="theme">
      { { theme } }
    </div>
  `
}
```

In this example, the <mark>Parent</mark> component is using the <mark>provide</mark> feature to make the <mark>theme</mark> property available to its descendants. The <mark>Child</mark> component is using the <mark>inject</mark> feature to access the <mark>theme</mark> property provided by its ancestor.

The <mark>inject</mark> option is an object that maps the name of the property to be injected (e.g. "theme") to the key of the property in the <mark>provide</mark> object. It can also be an array that contains the names of the properties to be injected.

It's important to notice that the provide and inject features are only available in the component's scope, not global.

Another way to use provide and inject is using the <mark>provide</mark> option in the component's <mark>options</mark> and <mark>inject</mark> option in the component's <mark>computed</mark> properties.

```vue
export default {
  name: 'Parent',
  provide: {
    theme: 'dark'
  },
  template: `
    <div>
      <Child />
    </div>
  `
}
```

```vue
export default {
  name: 'Child',
  computed: {
    ...inject('theme')
  },
  template: `
    <div :class="theme">
      { { theme } }
    </div>
  `
}
```

This way, the <mark>Child</mark> component can use the <mark>theme</mark> property as a computed property, so it can be reactive.
