# Props

If you are from the React world, you will be very familiar with props. Vue offers similar functionality with their prop system.

If not, hereâ€™s a short explanation of what props are: props are pieces of data that you pass down to child components.

Props fulfill the first part of a <mark>two-way communication</mark> system between components.

## Declaring Props

In the child component, we need to declare props and assign a type:

```vue
<template>
	<main>
		<h1> This is a header </h1>
		//render prop
		{{ props.subTitle }}
	</main>
</template>

<script setup>
import { defineProps } from 'vue';

//Define prop, prop name, and type
const props = defineProps({
	subTitle: String
})
</script>
```

## Passing Props

Passing a prop requires no declaration in the script. You create the prop name within the template and pass a value.

```js
<template>
	<main>
		//Component added, prop name declared, value passed to component
		<HeaderComponent subTitle="Welcome to Vue Reference" />
	</main>
</template>
```

In this example, we are calling a component called HeaderComponent. Then we declare a prop called <mark>subTitle</mark> and pass in a string value.

## Reactive Props

We can also make props dynamic:

```vue
<template>
	<main>
		//Component added, prop name declared, value passed to component
		<HeaderComponent :subTitle="subTitleValue" />
	</main>
</template>

<script setup>
    let subTitleValue = "Welcome to Vue Reference";
</script>
```

We use the <mark>v-bind directive</mark> (in this case the colon shorthand), and bind the variable subTitleValue to the prop we are passing.

## Passing Expressions

We can also create expressions within a prop:

```vue
<template>
	<main>
		//Component added, prop name declared, value passed to component
		<HeaderComponent :subTitle="subTitleValue 'by' author" />
	</main>
</template>

<script setup>
    let subTitleValue = "Welcome to Vue Reference";
	let author = "Brian Driscoll"
</script>
```

And you can pass booleans, object, arrays, and any other type value into a prop.
