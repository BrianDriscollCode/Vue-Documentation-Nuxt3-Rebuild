# Event Handling

Events are handled using the v-on directive. This directive, or @ for short, contain either an inline handler or a method handler.

<hr />

## Inline Handlers

An inline handler... handles all the logic inline. This example is fairly similar to the official docs because this example explains it in a very straightforward way.

```vue
//In template:
<button @click=”number++”> Add </button>

<p> Count is: { { number } } <p>

//In script:
data() {
    return {
        number: 1
    }
}
```
When clicking the button, the number will be incremented and then displayed within the paragraph tag.

<hr />

## Methods

These handlers will involve calling a method from the script. For example, let’s say I want to change an inline styling of a component using a button/method handler:

```vue
<script>
export default {

    data() {
        return {
            colorChoice: "green"
        }
    },

    methods: {
        changeColor(currentColor) {
            currentColor === "blue" ?

            this.colorChoice = "green";
            this.colorChoice = "blue";
        }
    }
}
</script>
```

```vue
<template>
    <h1> Event Handler </h1>

    <p :style="{backgroundColor: colorChoice}"> color background </p>

    <button @click="changeColor(colorChoice)"> switch color </button>
</template>
```
In the template, the p tag has an inline style for the background color. Instead of background-color like in CSS, this is instead backgroundColor. Inserted as the value for the backgroundColor is colorChoice which you can see is initialized in the script under the data section as “green”. This means the background will be the color green for the p tag.

The button is referring to a method called changeColor and accepts a parameter called currentColor. Using a ternary operator (JavaScript), we figure out if the currentColor matches “blue”. If it does, we toggle the color to green. If not, we toggle the color to blue.

## Event Modifiers

In an effort to separate out method logic from ingrained browser logic, Vue has created event modifiers for your events. The most common of these is event.preventDefault() which prevents the page from refreshing (usually used during form submits).

Instead of including the event.preventDefault() syntax within the method you are calling, it would be done inline within the template and element that is being clicked.

### *prevent

```vue
<form @submit.prevent> </form>
```

### *passive

This event modifier prevents event.preventDefault() from being called and is used for a smooth scrolling experience on mobile devices.

### *once

Only trigger the event once.

### *self

Only triggers if the event being called derives from the element itself, not a child of that element.

Just a quick example using the previous method handler example:

```vue
<button @click.self="changeColor(colorChoice)">

  switch color

  <button> Embed button </button>
</button>
```

We embed a button within a button just to make the logic explicit.

If you click the button within the button with the text “Embed button”, the method will not fire. Only when click the button itself outside of the “Embed button” will it fire.

```vue
<input :keyup.page-down="nextPage">

<input :keypress.q="quit">
```

Some other modifiers:

- .enter
- .tab
- .delete
- .esc
- .space
- .up
- .down
- .left
- .right

## System Modifiers

These serve as a type of "and" operator. A system modifier must be pressed along with another key or click modifier.

- .ctrl
- .alt
- .shift
- .meta (command key for Macintosh)

```vue
<input @keypress.ctrl.q="exit"/>
```

## Mouse Button Modifiers

- .left
- .right
- .middle
