# Ref and Reactive

This article explains how to make your components/pages reactive.

<b>What does reactive mean?</b>

When a <mark>reactive variable is changed</mark>, the component will be <mark>rerendered</mark> to show this update. In other words, reactive variables can be considered the "state" variables of your component.

## Reactive Variables

Reactive variables are <mark>objects</mark>. For example:

```vue
<template>
	<main>
		//Display the first and last name in the fullName object
		<p> {{ fullName.first }} {{ fullName.last }} </p>
	</main>
</template>

<script setup>
//import reactive fucntionality
import { reactive } from "vue";

//declare fullName and then make it a reactive object
let fullName = reactive({
	first: "Jack",
	last: "Reacher"
})
</script>
```

In the template of this example, <mark>fullName.first</mark> and <mark>fullName.last</mark> will render as <mark>Jack Reacher</mark>.

Now what if we want to change the name of from Jack Reacher to Jack Gemini?

```vue
<template>
	<main>
		<p> {{ fullName.first }} {{ fullName.last }} </p>

		//Adding a button that calls "changeLastName" method
		<button @click="changeLastName"> </button>
	</main>
</template>

<script setup>
import { reactive } from "vue";

let fullName = reactive({
	first: "Jack",
	last: "Reacher"
})

//Add method to change the property "last"
//inside the fullName reactive object
const changeLastName = () => {
    fullName.last = "Gemini";
}
</script>
```

We can target a specific property within the reactive object. In this case, we target the property <mark>last</mark> within the reactive object <mark>fullName</mark>.

If you wanted, you could just make one reactive object, call it state, and store all reactive variables you'd want to change within that component:

```vue
<script setup>
import { reactive } from "vue";

let localState = reactive({
	names: ["Jack Reacher", "Charlie Mann", "CooCoo Razzle"],
	companyName: "Jack Transportation Inc.",
	revenue: 450000
})

</script>
```

It's up to you how you want to structure your reactive variables. Unlike <mark>Ref</mark>, the other reactive type we are about to explain, <mark>Reactive REQUIRES an object</mark>. You cannot use another primitive/data type.

## Ref Variables

This is more akin to using a single variable that uses a single data type.

For example:

```vue
<template>
    <main>
		<h1>  {{ name }} </h1>
        <button @click="changeName"> Change Name </button>
	</main>
</template>

<script setup>
import { ref } from "vue";

//Declaring a ref variable
let name = ref("Joe");

//Change the value of name by calling name.value
const changeName = () => {
	name.value = "Brian";
}

</script>
```

The name variable is a ref variable with the value "Joe".

We then create a method called <mark>changeName</mark>. Notice how we call <mark>name.value</mark>, not just name alone. To access the data inside name, we need to use the <mark>.value syntax</mark>.

Once the button is clicked, <mark>changeName is called</mark>, and the h1 tag changes from "Joe" to "Brian".

You can use any data type within a ref variable. This is usually preferred amongst developer until they want to start tying together data logically. Then a reactive variable can be more suitable.

But here's a bonus tip (totally subjective): just use refs until you find a need for reactive. <mark>The .value syntax with ref makes it clear when working with reactive data.</mark>
