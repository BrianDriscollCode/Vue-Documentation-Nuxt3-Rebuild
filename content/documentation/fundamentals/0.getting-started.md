# Getting Started

We are going to use NPM to download the necessary tools to start scaffolding our Vue 3 project.

## What is Vue?

Vue is a JavaScript framework used for creating user interfaces. It allows you to break down your application into much smaller components. This allows for more seperation of concerns and an intuitive way to structure an application.

## Downloading Vue

To continue, you will need:

- Node.js: https://nodejs.org/en/download/
- npm: https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm

Now find a folder you want your Vue 3 project to be located in. Then type this command:

```js
npm init vue@latest
```
You will be prompted to create a name and select packages for your project. You will be using Vue Router, Pinia, and ESLint. See the image below which options you should select:

The command-line will show you how to finish installing your project. First, you need to enter the folder of your project:

```js
cd folder-name
```

Then you need to install the packages you have just downloaded.

```js
npm install
```

Now you can start your Vue 3 project!

```js
npm run dev
```
