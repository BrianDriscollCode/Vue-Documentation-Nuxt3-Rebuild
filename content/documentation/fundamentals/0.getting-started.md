# Getting Started

You can utilize basic html and JavaScript or Webpack/Vite to utilize Vue. In this section we will focus on using npm, the Vue CLI, and webpack to spin up the Vue framework.

## What is Vue?

Vue is a JavaScript framework used for creating user interfaces. It allows you to break down your application into much smaller components. This allows for more seperation of concerns and an intuitive way to structure an application.

## Downloading Vue

To continue, you will need:

- Node.js: https://nodejs.org/en/download/
- npm: https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm

Now with the terminal, we are going to get some native tooling. Install the Vue eco-system command-line interface, Vue CLI:

```js
npm install -g @vue/cli
```
Then pick a folder you want your project to be located in.

In that folder, type this in the terminal:

```js
vue create project-name
```
After it is done downloading. You can now spin up your project:

```js
npm run serve
```
