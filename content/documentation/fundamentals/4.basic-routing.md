# Basic Routing

Vue comes with an official router package, <a href="https://router.vuejs.org/introduction.html" target="_blank">Vue Router</a>.

When installing Vue 3, you are given an option to also install Vue Router. Just incase you skipped this option, you can also use NPM to get Vue Router in your project.

## Install Vue Router

#### npm
```js
npm install vue-router@4
```

#### yarn
```js
yard add vue-router@4
```
<hr />

## Add the Router

In the main.js file we need to instantiate the router:

```js
import { createApp } from 'vue'
import App from './App.vue'

//importing router
import router from './router'

const app = createApp(App)

//Insantiate router
app.use(router)
app.mount('#app')

```

## Init/Create Routes

In your router folder, find the index.js file. It should exist after installing the router with Vue 3 or standalone.

In this file you will create routes for your application to use in order to navigate to the pages, views, or components you want.

```js
import { createRouter, createWebHistory } from 'vue-router'
//Importing a view
import HomeView from '../views/HomeView.vue'
//Import a component
import About from "@/components/About.vue"

//Instantiate the router
const router = createRouter({
  history: createWebHistory(import.meta.env.BASE_URL),
  //Create routes using this array of objects 
  routes: [
	{
		path: '/',
		name: 'Hello',
		component: HomeView
	},
	{
		path: '/about',
		name: 'aboutPage',
		component: About
	}
]
})

export default router
```

In the router object, you will use the <mark>routes array</mark> to create your routes by adding a path, corresponding name, and the component/page you imported.

## Display Pages
Now you will find the parent page of your application. In most cases, this will be the app.vue file. Add a <mark>RouterView</mark> to your template.

```vue
<template>
    <main>
		//Displays the routes according to your router/index.js
		<RouterView> </RouterView>
	</main>
</template>
```
## Dynamic Route Matching

You may want to use your url to help make your page dynamic depending on the user's needs. For example, let's say you have multople contributing writers to your website. You want to show the articles written only by a specific contributor.

```js
const routes = [
	{
		path: "/author/:name",
		component: AuthorPage
	}
]
```

This is the route path we establish in router/index.js

Now we need to create the component/page for this route. Since we are using the composition API, we no longer have access to the dynamic part of the url via <mark>this.$route</mark>. Because of this, we get access to this information with <mark>useRoute</mark>:

```vue
<template>
	<main>
		<h1> Author </h1>
		{{ authorData }}
	</main>
</template>

<script setup>
	import { ref } from "vue";
	//import useRoute from vue-router
	import { useRoute } from "vue-router";

	//Instantiate and get route information
	const route = useRoute();

	//Take information from route and get the name of author
	const authorData = ref(route.params.name);
</script>
```

The const <mark>route</mark> variable is a reactive object. For example, let's say our route is <mark>/author/Jack</mark>.

Author is the route for the page, and Jack is the <mark>dynamic name</mark>. Remember how we made the route <mark>/author/:name</mark>

The colon indicates that this is a dynamicId that we want access to in the page. The useRoute function gives us access to the name information. Try it for yourself and <mark>console.log(route.params)</mark>.

Your console will show an object:

```js
{
	name: "Jack",
	[[Prototype]]: Object
}
```
And we use normal JavaScript to access this object by typing <mark> route.params.name </mark>

After getting the data from the URL, we added this information to a ref variable called <mark>authorData</mark> and displayed it to the template with mustache syntax.
