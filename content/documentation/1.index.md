# Introduction

This website a documentation of a single web developer's reading, implementation, and knowledge of Vue. These are not the official documents for reference.

However, I do think the information inside is valuable for as a quick reference for learning particular parts of Vue and for having it broken down that less seasoned programmers can understand it.

## The Focus

This website will look at Vue from the perspective of using WebPack, Vue CLI, and NPM. All the necessary tools to get started are in the "Getting-Started" Page.

I am also focusing on the <mark>Options API</mark> . In the future after I get a good handle on this part of Vue I will explore the <mark>Composition API</mark>.

One last thing! On top of concepts, the documentation also covers creating simple components from scratch. I think these maybe helpful for those new to Vue!
